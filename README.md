## Documentation of build/ What i've learnt

- Used Scanner Class to get input from user
- Built grids using 2D arrays and nested for loops to create interface.
- Used casting to char to generate A-Z options for each column - Unicode/ASCII values

## Things to improve

- More utilization of classes' attribute and methods to make Main less cluttered
- Incorporate lowerCase letter inputs
